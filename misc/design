The ACAP Configuration tool contains two main components: FCN Engine, and FCN Configuration. The FCN Engine implements the fundamental concepts and functionality required for creating, modifying and tuning a FCN. Additionally, it can compute and generate the best security configuration of a given FCN. The ACAP GUI provides the graphical interface for users to create, configure and tune the FCN.
